## (When) will you add framework X?

We are currently not focused on integrating additional AutoML systems.
However, we process any pull requests that add frameworks and will assist with the integration.
The best way to make sure framework X gets included is to start with the integration 
yourself or encourage the package authors to do so. For technical details see 
[Adding an AutoML Framework](./extending/framework.md).

It is also possible to open a Github issue indicating the framework you would like added.
Please use a clear title (e.g. "Add framework: X") and provide some relevant information 
(e.g. a link to the documentation).
This helps us keep track of which frameworks people are interested in seeing included.
