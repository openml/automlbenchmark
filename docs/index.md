# AutoML Benchmark

These are the AutoML Benchmark documentation pages with information on how to
configure and use the AutoML Benchmark tool. For first time users, we advise
visiting the [getting started](getting_started.md) page.

This documentation is accompanied by [our website](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/) 
which has information on [our papers](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/papers.html),
[integrated frameworks](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/frameworks.html), 
and [evaluation results](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/results.html).

!!! note "Help Wanted!"

    We recently switched to generating doc pages with `mkdocs-material`. In the process,
    we did our best to make sure to use the additional functionalities to better
    present the information and make it easy to find through notes, tabs, and other features.
    
    It is possible to find parts of the documentation are not updated (correctly), or
    are not clear. We welcome all help to improve the documentation. If you have a 
    suggestion on how to improve the documentation, please open an issue. If you find
    an error, please open an issue or open a pull request directly. Thanks! :pray:
